<h1 style="color:red">Roxiler-Sytems Transaction Information Project<h1/>
  
## About Project
The project aims to create a web page that displays transaction data using various APIs. The page includes a transactions table, a transactions statistics section, and a transactions bar chart. The transactions table lists transactions for a selected month, with the option to search for specific transactions by title, description, or price. Pagination functionality allows users to navigate through the transaction data. The transactions statistics section presents the total amount of sales, total sold items, and total unsold items for the selected month. The transactions bar chart visualizes the price range and the corresponding number of items within that range for the selected month. The project combines data from different APIs to provide a comprehensive view of transaction information in an intuitive and interactive manner.
